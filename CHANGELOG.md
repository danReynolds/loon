## 3.2.0

* Adds support for persisting serializable documents (primitives or custom classes with toJson support)
  using FilePersistor without specifying serializer.
* Fixes bug with ObservableDocument dependency updates.

## 3.1.0

* Updates to FilePersistor synchronization.

## 3.0.0

* Refactors dependency behavior into the dependency manager and de-dupes dependency references to improve performance.
* Moves base persistor batch/throttle behavior to the persist manager and updates persistence delays to be done at the task duration level in the manager and at the throttle duration in the file persistor implementation.
* Adds a caching layer to accessing observable values via get() ahead of a broadcast.

## 2.0.1

* Fix bug for deletion of documents with a document-level persistence key. 

## 2.0.0

* Rearchitecture of core implementation.

* [Breaking] Default behavior of deleting a document/collection is to recursively delete all nested data.
* `FilePersistor` changes:
    * [Breaking] Change from `getPersistenceKey` to `FilePersistor.key` and `FilePersistor.keyBuilder`.
    * [Breaking] Changed the default data store location from `loon.json` to `__store__.json`.
    * [Feature] Added ability to specify the collections/documents to hydrate when calling `Loon.hydrate()`.
